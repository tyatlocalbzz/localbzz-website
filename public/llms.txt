> Marketing for people who build things.

## About

LocalBzz is a marketing agency based in Flower Mound, Texas, serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. We help local businesses and entrepreneurs attract the right customers through authentic brand presence.

## What We Do

We provide full-service marketing for businesses where the owner IS the brand:

- **Content Creation**: Professional video and photography that captures who you really are
- **Brand Strategy**: Messaging that sounds like you, not generic marketing speak
- **Social Media Management**: Consistent presence on platforms where your customers are
- **Brand Development**: Translating what your best customers already know about you into visible content

## Our Approach

We don't invent brands. We translate them. Most agencies ask "what do you want to say?" We ask "what do your best customers already know about you that strangers can't see?" Then we make it visible.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Same Team Every Time**: You work with Jeff (Relationships), Ty (Words), and Corrie (Visuals). Not a rotating cast of account managers.

2. **90-Day Results**: We commit to demonstrable results within 90 days. If we can't show progress, you can walk away.

3. **We're Not Order-Takers**: We learn your business well enough to have opinions, and we act on them. You don't come up with ideas, we do.

## Ideal Customers

- Local businesses where the owner's personality IS the product
- Entrepreneurs who are great at what they do but struggle to communicate it
- Businesses whose best customers "just get it" but strangers can't see why
